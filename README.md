# App-Store-and-Google-Play
Profitable App Profiles for the App Store and Google Play Markets.

we outlined that our aim is to help our developers understand what type of apps are likely to attract more users on Google Play and the App Store. To do this, we'll need to collect and analyze data about mobile apps available on Google Play and the App Store.

As of September 2018, there were approximately 2 million iOS apps available on the App Store, and 2.1 million Android apps on Google Play.Collecting data for over 4 million apps requires a significant amount of time and money, so we'll try to analyze a sample of the data instead. To avoid spending resources on collecting new data ourselves, we should first try to see if we can find any relevant existing data at no cost. Luckily, these are two data sets that seem suitable for our goals:

    A data set containing data about approximately 10,000 Android apps from Google Play; the data was collected in August 2018. You can download the data set directly from this link.
    A data set containing data about approximately 7,000 iOS apps from the App Store; the data was collected in July 2017. You can download the data set directly from this link.
